i.code segment              ii.stack                iii. Heap           iv.Data segment

i.code segment :-Also known as the text segment, this stores the compiled program code, functions, and constants
ii.stack :- Stores local variables and function call information in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) structure. The stack is used for passing arguments to functions.
